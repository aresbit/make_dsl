Ok, that was a bit of a simplification.

What we're really going to do is construct a function which
constructs the rule tree. The example is more like this:

let rec
    lisp_o _ =
      let targ = "lisp.o" in
      let dep_names = List.flatten [ ["lisp.c"] ] in
      let deps = List.map resolve dep_names in
      let actions = [String.concat " "
                       (List.flatten [ ["gcc"]; ["-c"]; 
                                       [List.hd dep_names] ]) ] in
      Rule (targ, deps, actions)
and emacs _ =
      let targ = "emacs" in
      let dep_names = List.flatten [ "emacs.c"; "lisp.o"; "buffer.h"] in
      let deps = List.map resolve dep_names in
      let actions = [String.concat " "
                       (List.flatten [ ["gcc"]; ["-o"]; targ; 
                                       ["emacs.c"]; ["lisp.o"] ]) ] in
      Rule (targ, deps, actions)
