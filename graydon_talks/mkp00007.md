How it's going to work

Obviously we cannot write an entire compiler in one sitting
But we can steal parts of other compilers.

The two compilers we've got to work with are ocamlc and gcc.
We need to decide which to use, or whether to use both.

The decision depends on which runtime we'd prefer to use.
Ocaml runtime is 
large
complex
relatively obscure
C runtime is
tiny
simple
universally available

I expect most people in this audience would prefer the C runtime.
