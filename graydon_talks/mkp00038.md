Quasiquoting (part 1)

Quoting is OK for entering ASTs you know already.
But you don't always know all ASTs in advance.
If you did, you wouldn't need a compiler.

At best, you know parameterized ASTs.
AST templates, in other words, with gaps in them.


Terminology:

A normal quoted AST is called a quotation.
A quotation with gaps to fill in is called a quasiquotation.
A gap in a quasiquotation is called an antiquotation.
