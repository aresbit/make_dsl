Tools

I am going to use some weird tools.
They are not all from the FSF.
There is nothing magic about them.

Objective Caml (ocaml)
ML dialect
Functional / Imperative / OO language
From INRIA
LGPL runtime / QPL compiler

Camlp4
Ocaml pre-processor-pretty-printer
"like (defmacro ...) on steroids"

Cquot
C code quasiquoting for camlp4
written by me
