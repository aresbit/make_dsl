Semantic Model (part 3)

We will embed the variable model directly in Ocaml semantics
Makefile string
Ocaml list with single string
Makefile variable
Ocaml function returning flattened list
Makefile variable reference
Ocaml function call

There is an obscure type-inference reason why functions are used here instead of variables. 
When in doubt, try it with functions.

Example Makefile Fragment:
doggies = dingo.o poodle.o
animals = llama.o $(doggies) loris.o
...

Becomes Ocaml Functions:
let rec
     doggies _ = List.flatten [["dingo.o"]; ["poodle.o"]]
 and animals _ = List.flatten [["llama.o"]; doggies (); ["loris.o"]]
...
