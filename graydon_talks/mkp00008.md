Getting to the C runtime

The Ocaml compiler and runtime is not for everyone.

Ocaml is really good at producing C code though.

So we can make a translator from Makefiles to Ocaml programs
which generate C code, then run those programs to get our C code.

The end-user, in fact, doesn't even need to know about ocaml.

You can just give them the C code.

This is what we're going to do with Makefiles.
