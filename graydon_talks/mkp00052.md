The Driver (part 1)

All that remains is to write a driver:

Run ocamlc on input, with with custom camlp4 pre-processor
Chmod output file
Run output file, capture output to C file
Run gcc on C file
Chmod output file
Delete temporaries

Some command-line option processing and exception handling,
make the driver about as large as the back end.
