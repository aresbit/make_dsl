Quoting (final exam)

When we quote Ocaml code in Ocaml, like this:

let my_fn = <:expr<  List.iter (fun x -> x+1) [1; 2; 3] >>

It is NOT equivalent to writing this:

let my_fn = List.iter (fun x -> x+1) [1; 2; 3] 

But rather, it is equivalent to writing this:

let my_fn = ExApp (loc, ExApp (loc, ExAcc (loc, 
   ExUid (loc, "List"), ExLid (loc, "iter")),
     ExFun (loc, [(PaLid (loc, "x"), None, 
       ExApp (loc, ExApp (loc, ExLid (loc, "+"),
         ExLid (loc, "x")), ExInt (loc, "1")))])),
   ExApp (loc, ExApp (loc, ExUid (loc, "::"), ExInt (loc, "1")),
     ExApp (loc, ExApp (loc, ExUid (loc, "::"),
       ExInt (loc, "2")), ExApp (loc,
         ExApp (loc, ExUid (loc, "::"), ExInt (loc, "3")),
         ExUid (loc, "[]")))))
