Quoting (part 2)

For example, the AST for this Ocaml code:

List.map (fun x -> x+1) [1; 2; 3] 

Is written (in Ocaml) as this value:

ExApp (loc, ExApp (loc, ExAcc (loc, 
   ExUid (loc, "List"), ExLid (loc, "map")),
     ExFun (loc, [(PaLid (loc, "x"), None, 
       ExApp (loc, ExApp (loc, ExLid (loc, "+"),
         ExLid (loc, "x")), ExInt (loc, "1")))])),
   ExApp (loc, ExApp (loc, ExUid (loc, "::"), ExInt (loc, "1")),
     ExApp (loc, ExApp (loc, ExUid (loc, "::"),
       ExInt (loc, "2")), ExApp (loc,
         ExApp (loc, ExUid (loc, "::"), ExInt (loc, "3")),
         ExUid (loc, "[]")))))

Which is completely tedious to write down.
