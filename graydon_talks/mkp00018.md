The ; character is a separator, not terminator.

foo ();                          foo ();
bar ();                          bar ();
baz ();                          baz ()

Some idioms are worth translating

  if (z) {                           Some x -> (* "ok" *)          
    /* non-NULL means OK */        | None   -> (* "nothing" *)
  } else {
    /* NULL means "nothing" */
}
