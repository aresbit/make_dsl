Quoting (part 1)

So far, we have been talking about consuming code.
Lexing, parsing, modelling semantics.

Next, we will be dealing with producing code.
Computing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).

Our front-end will compute Ocaml ASTs for ocamlc.
To take advantage of ocamlc's semantic analysis.

Our back-end will compute C ASTs for gcc.
To take advantage of gcc's code generator and runtime.

ASTs are very tedious to write down.
In fact, even small fragments of ASTs are tedious to write down.
