Quoting (part 4)

The way quoting works is simple and dirty.

You want an AST for some code:

List.map (fun x -> x+1) [1; 2; 3] 

So you write that code in magic quotes:

<:expr< List.map (fun x -> x+1) [1; 2; 3] >>

Then you run it through a pre-processor.
The pre-processor substitutes the AST of the quoted code.
The compiler never sees the magic quotes.
It is as though you wrote the AST there instead.
