The Driver (part 2)

We use the "shell" module of Ocaml, since it looks a lot like writing
shell scripts with flexible, argument processing, I/O and exception
handling.  It is pretty straightforward:

 ...
 call [cmd "ocamlc" ["-pp"; homedir ^ "/mkc-fe -impl"; 
                     "-o"; runfile; "-I"; homedir;
                     "-I"; "frontc"; "frontc.cma"; "be.cmo"; 
                     "-impl"; makefile ]];
 Unix.chmod runfile 0o700;
 call ~stdout:(to_file cfile) [cmd runfile []];
 call [cmd "gcc" ["-O2"; "-o"; outfile; cfile]];
 Unix.chmod outfile 0o755;
 ...

Look familliar?
