# Talk 47 - Graydon's MKC Series

```

Back end (part 1)

Recall that the compiler we are building is a 2-stage system.

Front End
Lex and parse Makefile
Syntax checking happens here
Synthesize Ocaml program
Compile Ocaml program with ocamlc
Static semantic checking happens here 

Back End
Run compiled Ocaml program
Capture synthesized C program
Compile C program with gcc

We have completed the guts of the front end.
The back end really only requires us to write one function.
It is the function that calculates a C program from an Ocaml value.
