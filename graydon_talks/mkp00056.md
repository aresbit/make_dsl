Q&A (part 1: shameless promotion)

Q: Do I have to learn some icky language to do this?
A: Yes. It's really not that icky.

Q: Aw, couldn't we just have done this in m4 or a Perl script?
A: Not without losing a lot of convenience and safety.

Q: Does Ocaml have:
a debugger, a profiler, lex and yacc?
arrays, for loops, printf, and fast I/O?
generics, modules, and typesafety?
hashtables, objects, and garbage collection?
map, fold, lambda, cons, and quote?
an emacs mode and a free, portable compiler?
A: Yup.

Q: Why am I still coding in C/C++/Java/Lisp?
A: Beats me.
