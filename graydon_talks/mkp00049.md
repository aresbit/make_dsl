Back end (part 3)

The C program will do "the work" of a Makefile.
The recursive algorithm (vaguely) is:

int check_node_foo_c (time_t parent) {
        time_t mtime = 0;
        int rebuild = 0;
        struct stat target;
        if (stat ("foo.c", &target) == -1)
                rebuild = 1;
        else
                mtime = statr.st_mtime;
        rebuild = check_first_dep  (mtime) || rebuild;
        // ...
        if (rebuild) {
                write (1, "gcc -c foo.c\n", 13);
                system ("gcc -c foo.c");
                return 1
        }
        else
                return mtime > parent;
}

With some extra error handling thrown in.
