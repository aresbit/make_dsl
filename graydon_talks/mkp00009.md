# Talk 9 - Graydon's MKC Series

```

The Big Picture (textual)

We are going to stitch together a "virtual compiler"

Makefile is translated to Ocaml program
Lexed and Parsed
Ocaml AST produced

Ocaml program is fed into ocamlc
Typechecked and compiled

Compiled Ocaml program is executed
Produces a C program

C program is fed into gcc
Resulting object file depends on nearly nothing
