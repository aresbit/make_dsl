# Talk 2 - Graydon's MKC Series

```

Greetings

This is a talk about rapidly constructing compilers for
domain-specific languages (DSLs). It is a little dense. 
To get through it, I am going to start with a number 
of facts which I will simply state and assume as true.

Domain-specific languages are good
"nearly ideal" software system abstractions
better than commands, APIs, object frameworks
very hard to identify and refine
even harder to implement well

DSL implementations are typically
a lot of effort
poor quality
slow
unsafe
incorrect
