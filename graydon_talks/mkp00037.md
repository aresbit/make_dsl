Quoting (summary, Q&A)

Quoting makes synthesizing ASTs completely trivial.
Avoid it at your own peril.

Q: What if my Object language has the lexeme >> in it?
A: Escape it: \>\> 

Q: What if there is a parse error in a quotation?
A: The pre-processor will emit an error.

Q: Doesn't pre-processing distort source co-ordinates?
A: No, the pre-processor preserves source co-ordinates.

Q: Is my code parsed a second time after pre-processing?
A: No, the pre-processor and compiler are tightly integrated.
