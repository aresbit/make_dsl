Quasiquotations (summary)

Quasiquotations permit combination of ASTs, without having to give up
the convenience of quotation.

With camlp4 we can make new types of quasi and anti quotations.

Whenever you are faced with having to build ASTs, start by making sure
you have a good collection of quotations for your object language.

In the remaining section, we are going to complete the compiler.
The front end will produce quotations of Ocaml code.
The back end will produce quotations of C code.

Emacs hates quotations.
