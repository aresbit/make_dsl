Q&A (part 2: this particular compiler)

Q: Why a Makefile compiler? Isn't that dumb?
A: It's a simple language everyone knows.

Q: Can I use this for huge Makefiles with lots of funny functions?
A: No. You probably don't want to use it. It's still pretty minimal.

Q: So you lied! This isn't a "one-day compiler" at all, is it?
A: For a small DSL, a day (or a few) is enough to get it going.

Q: And for larger languages?
A: You may find your language semantics make the embedding harder.

Q: Where can I get the code to play with it?
A: http://www.venge.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/venge/code/src/mkc/

Q: Is this part of Red Hat's secret plan?
A: No. I just do this on my own time.
