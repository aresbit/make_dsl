int foo (int bar) {              let foo bar = bar + 1
   return bar + 1;
}


Wait! Where are all the int type terms?
They are inferred them from the use of  + 1


template <typename T>            let foo bar = bleh bar
T foo (T x) {
  return bleh (x);
}

Yes, it infers polymorphic types too.
